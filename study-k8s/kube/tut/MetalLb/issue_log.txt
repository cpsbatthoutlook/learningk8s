## vagrant@master:~/tut/metallb/Richard_Baremetal-Journey  WORKS!!

## But external-IP works only from the certain nodes within Cluster and nothing from outside :  curl  http://192.168.0.50
   ## Tried Local vs Cluster External/Internal TrafficPolicy 
     ## Seems like the Cluster-IP and External-IP not visible to outside world. [ EVEN for the nodes with were unSchduled]
     ##  NodePort works everytime
       ## Will try to integrate with Traefik
